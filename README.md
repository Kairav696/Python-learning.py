# Python Coding Journey 🚀

Welcome to my Python Coding Journey.

This repository documents my journey of learning Python from the very basics.  
I am learning step by step and sharing everything I practice along the way.

This repository is meant for beginners who want to see real progress, not perfect code.

## Why I started this journey
I wanted to learn coding properly from the basics and stay consistent.  
Instead of just learning silently, I decided to document my progress on GitHub and YouTube.

This helps me:
- stay consistent  
- track my improvement  
- help other beginners who are starting like me

## How I am learning
- Learning Python from scratch  
- Practicing daily with small programs  
- Focusing on understanding concepts, not rushing  
- Improving one step at a time  

---

## Tools I use
- iPad  
- Pyto (Python IDE for iPad)  

This shows that you don’t need a powerful laptop to start learning coding.
